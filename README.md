I ended up breaking this data up into smaller segments for training and testing dats. This data has a lot of features and has endless options of what we can do with it.Ill be Looking for features from the intrusion data that we can accurately predict what type of intrusion this was. This data set has 30 different classes of intrusions, so in the end game finding a few useful features to us this in a prediction model
